# Andrew Gowards Resume

This will be a website that combines simplicity and functionality for the use of Recruiters or potential employers/coabilaters. It is easy to follow and  to use and will provide concise information about myself, my work/education history, projects and also feature a download of my CV.

Aswell as this it will include a contact form for anyone interested in working with me on projects.
 
## UX
 
### This website is for:
* Recruiters 

* Potential collaborators 

* Employers 

### What they want to achieve:
* Learn about me and my current situation 

* Learn what coding languages I am proficient in 

* Learn a work and education history 

*	See what projects I have been involved in

*	Contact me 

*	Download my CV for more in depth information 

*	(Most important) do it in a time efficient way 

### How will they achieve it:
* By making my website mobile first I can achieve a suitable layout of the website across all platforms just for the instance a user looks at it on mobile/tablet/desktop 

*	All sections will be clear and concise to deliver as much information in a short space of time 

*	There will be different pages so a user can jump from to the most relevant information 

*	Each of my integrated links will open on a separate tab to avoid the user coming away from the main content 

### Wireframes 

For this I used balsamiq please find the pdf in the **Wireframes** file 

## Existing Features 
*	Navigation bar- allows all users to select the content they want to view by simply clicking them , this also collapses into a toggle on mobile devices to maintain space 

*	Subheadings-this allows users find the information they need 

*	Graph- this allows users see which languages I am proficient in , in a easy to read/understand manner 
*	Timeline- can easily see my professional life in a date order 
*	Carousel- can easily see my projects and can click the links to open a new tab to view my projects in work 
*	Contact form- separate boxes for name , email , and description  and a submit button 
*	Social links- to view my different social pages in a new tab 
*	Download link- to download my CV in pdf format and view it in a new tab 
### Features I would like 
*	Examples of different coding languages I have used to best showcase what I can do 
### Technologies used
*	HTML5- standard language of a webpage 

*	CSS3- for customised styling 
*	Javascript- I used this for the automaton of the navbar and carousel 
*	Bootstrap – I used this for styling of the webpage and to make it more responsive 

## Testing 
During the creation of this project I viewed the webpage in the browser and used google developer tools to make sure the project looks good and works on all devices.
i tested each user story as follows:
*	Learn about me and my current situation- go to home page , read about me 

*	Learn what languages I am proficient in – go to home page – under subsection “what can I do" – can clearly see a graph starting with what I’m comfortable in going down 
*	Learn about my work and education- click on the resume section on nav bar – can see all my work and education history in a timeline format 
*	See what projects I have been involved in- click on the projects section on nav bar – can see my projects in a carousel format with links – if viewing on mobile devices can see this in a list view as to not slow down the website- each link opens in new tab
*	Contact me – click on contact section on the nav bar – can clearly see a form with clear placeholder text – type invalid information – see invalid input message – type correct information and see success box 
*	Download cv – scroll down to footer on every page see the message “download CV” click on the download symbol – CV downloads in pdf format and can be viewed in separate tab
*	Do in a time efficient way – everything is set out in headings and sub headings so the user can jump to necessarily information 


This project also works on all devices and changes to fit the screen. There was a interesting bug when I followed the wireframes the hero image and the navigation bar was different on every device view,  ie the image looked different . But after speaking to my mentor he suggested placing the nav bar above the hero image which fixed all bugs .
